## 🤖 What Is an FFXIV Bot?

A **bot** in FFXIV is a script or tool that automates gameplay: combat, gathering, fishing, crafting, questing, or gil farming. These bots mimic real inputs, use pathing logic, and support class-specific rotations for clean, efficient farming with minimal human input.

They run 24/7, can be customized with profiles, and can even run multiple characters if you’re farming hard.

## 🔐 Is Botting Safe in Final Fantasy XIV?

⚠️ Square Enix monitors unusual behavior but has **no aggressive anti-cheat system**. Most bans are **manual**, often from:

* Player reports
* Stuck movement patterns
* Botting in public zones during high traffic
* Market manipulation detection

✅ Use bots in:

* **Private maps, instanced zones, low-pop areas**
* **Closed hours (overnight runs)**
* **Semi-legit modes (mixed input, custom timings)**

🛡️ *Private bots with randomized delays, human-like movement, and gear swap logic are much harder to detect.*

🗨️ *“Made over 10 mil gil last week just letting it gather and craft on loop.”*
🗨️ *“The fishing bot is insane. Hit all the rare fish for turn-ins without lifting a finger.”*
